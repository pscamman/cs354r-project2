Mr. Gorbachev tear down this wall!

Note:
We do not have any GUI stuff yet because we are a two man group and we will ask team Amazon for help with it later.

Revisions:

Right now we are trying to tie many things to the physics timer. Bullet seems to do its own thing, but we are giving it a callback that occurs every time a physics step occurs. We talked about manually rendering the Ogre frames but we currently reverted to just calling the startRendering() method. We are reconsidering our method of firing projectiles but the basic functionality will remain the same. In general all our functionality except for GUI and score system is in place, all we need to do now is add some basic enemies and make everything look better and be more interesting.

Adding as many gameplay elements to the game went by the wayside because it took a long time to get our physics and sound working properly. It's hard working with just two people but we did it anyway. It was nice that we are allowed to receive help from team Amazon but it would be way better to have a dedicated third person. We will adopt their GUI code but at the time of writing this their GUI was a very basic hack and we are just going to wait for them to have a real GUI.
